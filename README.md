# hotel_reservation_system

I developed a full-featured Hotel Reservation System using SQL and ER modeling to simulate real-world hotel operations. The project includes a well-structured relational schema with entities like guests, employees, reservations, rooms, and payments. It supports relationship cardinalities like one-to-many and many-to-many with foreign keys and constraints. I also created analytical queries to track revenue, guest behavior, and employee activity â€” all powered by a normalized SQL database.
